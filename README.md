# Pokémon SQL Project

## 🐾 Project Overview
This project is based on a dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlomuscio/pokemon) that contains information about Pokémon. I developed this project using SQL to perform various analyses and derive insights from the data.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset includes various attributes of Pokémon, including but not limited to:
- Pokémon names
- Types
- Base stats (Attack, Defense, Speed, etc.)
- Generaion
- Legandary

## 🛠️ Project Steps

### 1. Data Exploration
I began by exploring the dataset to understand its structure and the types of analyses that could be conducted. This involved examining the data types, null values, and general distribution of the data.

### 2. SQL Queries
After familiarizing myself with the dataset, I wrote SQL queries to address specific questions and cases, such as:
- Finding the most powerful Pokémon based on base stats.
- Analyzing the distribution of Pokémon types.
- Investigating the relationships between different attributes.

### 3. Data Manipulation
I performed necessary data manipulations to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. This included:
- Handling missing values.
- Normalizing data formats.
- Creating new calculated fields as needed.

### 4. Reporting
The results of my SQL queries were documented, and relevant outputs were included to support the findings. I provided clear insights into the trends and patterns observed in the data.

## 📁 Files Included
- **`pokemon_data.sql`**: The SQL scripts used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **`pokemon_analysis_results.docx`**: A document summarizing the findings from the analyses, including tables and screenshots.

## 📜 Usage Instructions
1. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlomuscio/pokemon).
2. Import the dataset into your SQL database.
3. Execute the SQL scripts provided in `pokemon_data.sql` to replicate the analyses.
4. Review the results in the `pokemon_analysis_results.docx` document for insights.

## 💡 Note
This project showcases the ability to analyze and visualize data using SQL. Feel free to reach out for any suggestions or feedback!

## ❓ Cases

- Separate Pokemons by type 

- Prepare a table showing how many Pokemon of each type there are.

- Sort the types according to their total power, find the strongest type and visualize it

- Find and visualize the fastest and slowest pokemon by generation

- Visualize the strongest, weakest and non-legendary pokemon.

- Show fastest and slowest pokemon regardless of generation

- Sort by HP

- Sort by Defense

- Sort by Attack

- Calculating the Average Stats of Pokemon: Generate an overall Pokemon average power report by calculating the average of each Pokemon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.).
